## Setup the Project

### Setup 42 oauth

Add this to redirect URI in 42 API settings:
```
http://localhost:3333/api/oauth/42
```

### Environment Setup
To make the project work, create a `.env` file in the backend folder with the following content:

```bash
TZ=UTC
PORT=3333
LOG_LEVEL=info
APP_KEY= # generate a new APP_KEY with gpg --gen-random --armor 1 16
NODE_ENV=development
DB_HOST=database
DB_PORT=5432
SESSION_DRIVER=cookie
HOST=0.0.0.0
TMDB_API_KEY= # add your TMDB API key here

CLIENT_SECRET= # add your 42 API secret here
GITHUB_CLIENT_ID= # add your github API client ID here
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET= # add your github API secret here
```

Also, create a `.env` file in the frontend folder with the following content:

```bash 
# this is a temporary solution

NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3333
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLIENT_ID= # add your 42 API client ID here
NEXT_PUBLIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID= # add your github API client ID here
