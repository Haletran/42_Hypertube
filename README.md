# 42_Hypertube

This project aims to create a web application that enables userâ€™s to search for and
watch videos.

## STACK

- Front: NextJS (with React in typescript)
- Backend: AdonisJS (REST API)
- DB: Postgres
- CSS Lib: Tailwind CSS
- Components Lib: shadcn
- Movie API: TMDB (since IMDB require AWS account and use graphQL)

## TODO

- [x] Fix db models for User (add AlreadyWatched feature and add migration / model for it)
- [x] Create a basic front template
- [x] Torrent downloader and viewer
- [x] Torrent fetcher (PirateBay or PrivateTracker)
- [x] Add Comments section for each movie
- [x] Selection of movies via bar (check discord video) (already movie or not [.mp4 | .hls])
- [x] Fix search bar to search for movies (problem with spaces etc..., parsing)
- [x] Create Register / Login / Oauth2 to access the website
- [x] Make all the API routes work and secure them with Session token
- [x] On front-page, only render movies that are on the view and remove the others
- [x] Make Profile and settings page
- [x] Make already watched movies page / and render in the /dashboard
- [x] Add a menu to see all the movies that are currently being downloaded
- [x] Make the comments works (still need to implement updated_at and created_at)
- [x] Add filter for dashboard page (by date, by rating, by genre)
- [x] Forget password mail
- [x] Do websocket for comments section and currently watching movies (update in real time)
- [x] Add cronjob to delete old torrents (1 months old)
- [x] Setup frontend validation with Zod (to add multiple validators backend and frontend)
- [x] Add first_name and last_name to the user
- [x] Add show nsfw content option
- [x] Make the frontend rules for password and everything else the same in the backend
- [x] Make the traduction for every page

## FIXES

- [x] Player not loading correctly if the mp4 is available - infinite reload error (if you reboot the server)
- [x] Fix status in /movie/:id page (fetching infinitily)
- [x] Fix rendering of currently watching movies (if timecode watched is 0, it should not be displaying the title and the movie card)
- [x] Fix subtitles error (IDK why security error)
- [x] Fix the footer (misplaced on mobile)
- [x] Make the current download menu on navbar update if the user have a new download (not refreshing if not open for performance - or use a websocket)
- [x] When the user logout it does not remove the session cookie in the database since logout does not work
- [x] Add clickable to the movie in download menu in navbar
- [x] Remove useless console.log and fetching
- [x] Fix useless call to the backend (debounce needed for settings page)
- [x] Fix movie remover (dk if it works)
- [x] Cannot remove comments anymore

## BONUS

- Chat
- Admin role
- Option NSFW
- Download progression
- A lot of ergonomic feature (filter/cache progress/status progress on profil/subtitles/source fetcher/api route/etc...)
